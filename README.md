# Terraform Module template

This repository is meant to be a template for creating new terraform modules.

## Creating a new Terraform Module

1. Clone this repo, renaming appropriately.
1. Write your terraform code in the root dir.
1. Ensure you've completed the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup).
1. In the root dir, run `go mod init MODULE_NAME` to get a new `go.mod` file. Then run `go mod tidy`. This creates a new `go.sum` file and imports the dependencies and checksums specific to your repository.
1. Update the terratest tests in the examples and test directories.
1. Run your tests to ensure they work as expected using instructions below.

## Usage

Add Usage information here

Resources:

* [Article Example](https://article.example.com)

```hcl
module "example" {
  source = "dod-iac/example/aws"

  tags = {
    Project     = var.project
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run all terratest tests using the `terratest` script.  If using `aws-vault`, you could use `aws-vault exec $AWS_PROFILE -- terratest`.  The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is required by the tests.  Use `TT_SKIP_DESTROY=1` to not destroy the infrastructure created during the tests.  The go test command can be executed directly, too.

## Terraform Version
