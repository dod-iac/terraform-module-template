# Terraform Module template

This repository is meant to be a template for creating new terraform modules.

## Creating a new Terraform Module

1. Clone this repo, renaming appropriately.  
1. Write your terraform code in the root dir.  
1. Ensure you've completed the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup).  
1. In the root dir, run `go mod init MODULE_NAME` to get a new `go.mod` file. Then run `go mod tidy`. This creates a new `go.sum` file and imports the dependencies and checksums specific to your repository.  
1. Run your tests to ensure they work as expected using instructions below.
